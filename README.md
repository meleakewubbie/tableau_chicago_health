# Mapping Public Health with Tableau

1. I retrieved public health and geospatial data from the Chicago Data Portal:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Statistics-Selected-public-health-in/iqnk-2tcu

2. I found health indicators of personal interest and ones that are related. I chose to map gonorrhea in males and unemployment. Unemployment is represented as a choropleth map and gonorrhea in males is represented as a graduated symbol map when they are displayed separately. However, when they are combined, a hybrid map is created. I selected these public health indicators because I wanted to see if there is a relationship between the two variables.


3. I noticed that the northeast part of Chicago has low rates of gonorrhea in males and unemployment. This could be due to residents in this area having higher accessibility to healthcare and more access to employment opportunities. For example, Lincoln Park in the northeast has a rate of 93.1 for gonorrhea in males and 4.5% unemployment, while Fuller Park in the southeast has a rate of 1556.4 for gonorrhea in males and 40% unemployment. Overall, communities in the southeast tend to have higher rates of gonorrhea in males and unemployment compared to those in the northeast.
