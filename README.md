# Mapping Public Health with Tableau

1. I retrieved public health and geospatial data from the Chicago Data Portal:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Statistics-Selected-public-health-in/iqnk-2tcu

2. I found health indicators of personal interest and one's that have relationship. I chose to map gonorrhea in males and un-employment. Un-employment is a choropleth map and gonorrhea in males is a graduated symbol map, when they are separated. However, when they are combined, a hybrid map is created. I picked these public health indicators because I want to see if there’s a relationship between the two variables.

4. I noticed that the north-east part of Chicago has low rates of gonorrhea in males and un-employment. The people who live there could have higher accessibility to health care than other parts of Chicago. In addition, they could have more access to employment opportunities. Lincoln park, in north-east Chicago, has a gonorrhea in male’s rate of 93.1 with 4.5% un-employment. Fuller park, in south-east Chicago, has a gonorrhea in male’s rate of 1556.4 with 40% un-employment. Communities within the south-east part of Chicago have higher rates of gonorrhea in males and un-employment compared to the north-east.
