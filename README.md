# Mapping Public Health with Tableau

1. I retrieved public health and geospatial data from the Chicago Data Portal:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Statistics-Selected-public-health-in/iqnk-2tcu

2. I found health indicators of personal interest and one's that have relationship. I chose to map gonorrhea in males and un-employment. Un-employment is a choropleth map and gonorrhea in males is a graduated symbol map, when they are separated. However, when they are combined, a hybrid map is created. I picked these public health indicators because I want to see if thereâ€™s a relationship between the two variables.
